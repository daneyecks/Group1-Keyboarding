			<h1>Recipient’s Address</h1><br>
			<p> This is the address you are sending your letter to. Be sure to make it as complete as possible so it gets to its destination. Always include title names (such as Dr.) if you know them. This is, like the other address, on the left margin. If a standard 8 ½” x 11” paper is folded in thirds to fit in a standard 9” business envelope, the inside address should appear through the window in the envelope (if there is one). Be sure to skip a line after the heading and before the recipient’s address, then skip another line after the inside address before the greeting. For an example, see the end of this sheet for a sample letter.</p>

			<h1>The Salutation</h1>
			<p>The salutation (or greeting) in a business letter is always formal. It often begins with “Dear {Person’s name}.” Once again, be sure to include the person’s title if you know it (such as Ms., Mrs., Mr., or Dr).  If you’re unsure about the person’s title or gender then just use their first name. For example, you would use only the person’s first name if the person you are writing to is “Jordan” and you do not know whether they identify as male, female, or non-binary.
				The salutation always ends with a colon.</p>

				<h1> The Body</h1><br>
				<p>The body is the meat of your letter. For block and modified block letter formats, single space and left justify each paragraph. Be sure to leave a blank line between each paragraph, however, no matter the format. Be sure to also skip a line between the salutation and the body, as well as the body and the close.</p>

				<h1> Complimentary Close</h1><br>
				<p>The complimentary close is a short and polite remark that ends your letter. The close begins at the same justification as your date and one line after the last body paragraph. Capitalize the first word of your closing (Thank you) and leave four lines for a signature between the close and the sender’s name. A comma should follow the closing.</p>

				<h1> Signature Line</h1><br>
				<p>Skip at least four lines after the close for your signature, and then type out the name to be signed. If you are printing this letter out and sending it by mail, you will sign your name in pen. This line will include your first and last name, and often includes a middle initial, although it is not required. You may put your title beforehand to show how you wish to be addressed (Ms., Mrs., Dr.).
					The signature should be in blue or black ink.</p>
